# Hate Speech Detection with Machine Learning
* Hate speech is one of the serious issues we see on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook daily.
* Most of the posts containing hate speech can be found in the accounts of people with political views.
* So, if you want to learn how to train a hate speech detection model with machine learning, this article is for you.
* There is no legal definition of hate speech because peopleâ€™s opinions cannot easily be classified as hateful or offensive.
Nevertheless, the United Nations defines hate speech as any type of verbal, written or behavioural communication that can attack or use discriminatory language regarding a person or a group of people based on their identity based on religion, ethnicity, nationality, race, colour, ancestry, gender or any other identity factor.
* Hope you now have understood what hate speech is.
* Social media platforms need to detect hate speech and prevent it from going viral or ban it at the right time.
* So in the section below, I have build a Hate speech detection with machine learning using the Python programming language.

### Dataset
* The dataset here used for hate speech detection task is downloaded from Kaggle.
* This Dataset can be download from the given link :- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amankharwal/Website-data/master/twitter.csv
* This dataset was originally collected from Twitter and contains the following columns:
1. Index
2. Count
3. Hate_speech
4. Offensive_language
5. Neither
6. Class
7. Tweet

* Reference :- I have taken reference from this article https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/07/25/hate-speech-detection-with-machine-learning/
* I would like to thank for providing & sharing knowledge with us.
